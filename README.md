# Advanced-Python-Devloper
One REAL Python project per day. From ZERO to Facial Recognition. Machine Learning, Data Science, Django, IGU, Games+


You're going to create Python code that asks your friend to answer two questions that 
require a single word each, and then displays those combined words on the screen to 
form a creative brand. 
You can use any questions you want. The idea is for the outcome to be original, 
creative, and even funny. And if you want to add some difficulty to your challenge, I 
suggest you try to have the name of the beer printed in quotation marks on the screen.
